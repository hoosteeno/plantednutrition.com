          <p>
            Nutrition therapy is the practice of establishing healthy food and lifestyle habits in order to obtain optimal health and wellness. It is founded on the idea that <strong>better health is possible through better nutrition</strong>.  Nutrition therapy also takes a holistic, in-depth look at personal relationships to food and the body and how these relationships are connected to health.
